ALGORITHM TO FIND SECOND LARGEST NUMBER IN AN ARRAY

STEP 1: Start 
STEP 2: Initialize the index of array[0] element as 0
STEP 3: Start traversing the array from array[1]. 
STEP 4: If the element in the current index is greater than the number in the first then update the first and second as
STEP 5: second = first
        first = array[i]
STEP 6: If the element is between the first and second value then update the second to the current value
        second=a[i]
STEP 7: Print the value that is stored in the second.
STEP 8: Stop.
